So I went ahead and implemented an app for that! Aleator helps you stick to your goals by letting RNG make the hard choices. We're good at setting high-level goals, and the RNG both enforces discipline and rewards you with treats sometimes.

The name comes from "aleatoric" - relating to chance or randomness (alea = ðŸŽ²). Aleator lets you gradually improve your habits while tracking your progress along the way.

This project was an experiment in vibe coding (one-handed, due to a recent injury) with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) -- I provided setup, scaffolding, and high-level guidance, but touched maybe 1% of the code.

## Features

- ðŸŽ² Create probabilistic decision rules (e.g., "have dessert with 67% probability")
- ðŸ“Š Track your progress
- ðŸŽ¨ ["Matsu" Ghibli theme by Matt Wierzbicki](https://matsu-theme.vercel.app/)
